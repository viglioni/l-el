** Added
- Custom exceptions in =l-exception.el=
- =lpipe= function in =l-functions=
- more type predicates and aliases
  - =:alist= =:plist= =:array= =:sequence= (=:seq=) =:bool-vector= (=:bvector=) =:char-table= (=:ctable=)
  - =:struct= =:object= =:record= =:instance= for cl-defstruct and EIEIO class instances

- parameterized type matching with =:instance_of=, =:list_of=, and =:list_of_instances=
  - =:instance_of= - matches specific struct/class types: =(x :instance_of point)=

  - =:list_of_instances= - matches lists of specific instance type: =(pts :list_of_instances point)=
  - new specificity scoring system: value (1M) > parameterized type (10K) > regular type (100) > wildcard (1)
- custom error types for better error handling:
  - =l-unknown-type-predicate-error= - invalid type predicates
  - =l-invalid-pattern-error= - invalid pattern syntax
  - =l-invalid-rest-parameter-error= - incorrect :rest parameter usage
  - =l-internal-error= - internal library errors
